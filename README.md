I am a second-year Information Security engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity and hands-on system defense. I have a foundational understanding of network protocols, system monitoring, and log analysis, and I actively practice simulating cyberattacks and defensive techniques in lab environments using virtual machines and other platforms. I am eager to gain real-world experience in a SOC environment, where I can apply my knowledge, learn from professionals, and grow into a future threat hunting.

## Objective

My journey in cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
